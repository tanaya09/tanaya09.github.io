  Built a real-time emergency detection pipeline by ingesting Reddit data using Kafka and Spark Structured Streaming.  
  • Integrated a locally hosted LLM-based classifier to tag crisis posts, storing enriched metadata in MongoDB  
  • Embedded 1,000+ Reddit posts using Sentence Transformers, stored semantic vectors in Qdrant  
  • Designed an interactive Plotly dashboard for real-time crisis trends and semantic search across incoming posts

I'm currently a second year masters student majoring in Computer Science at NYU Tandon School of Engineering with a GPA of 3.88, I have completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering from Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) formerly known as Pune University with a CGPA of 8.7.


I’m passionate about building scalable, reliable systems whether it’s full-stack web apps, backend APIs, ETL systems or AI-integrated services. I enjoy solving real-world problems through clean architecture, performance optimization, and thoughtful design.

As a Full Stack Developer Intern at Referrio.io, I’ve built and maintained scalable web applications using React (TypeScript), Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I enjoy building products end-to-end — from designing responsive frontends to optimizing backend APIs and database queries.

My projects reflect my passion for intelligent, scalable systems. I developed an AI Resume Builder deployed on Vercel with Stripe-powered subscriptions and real-time autosave. I also built CrisisCast, a real-time crisis detection system using Kafka, PySpark, and FastAPI, deployed with Docker and MongoDB, supporting 180+ records/sec throughput.

I’m always excited about backend engineering, ML-integrated pipelines, and cloud-native architectures. My current toolbox spans across Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C++, R, and SQL. I regularly work with frameworks and libraries like React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, Django, Django REST Framework, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy. For data handling and APIs, I’ve worked extensively with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, REST APIs, and technologies like AJAX, XML, and DAX.

On the big data and streaming side, I’ve implemented real-time pipelines using Apache Kafka, PySpark, and Hadoop. I’m comfortable deploying containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes, managing infrastructure with AWS services like EC2, S3, and CloudFront, and using platforms like Snowflake, Vercel, and Netlify for cloud deployment. I also bring experience with Linux environments, GitHub Actions for CI/CD, and tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Streamlit for data visualization and reporting.

Hi, I’m Tanaya Pawar a software engineer passionate about building intelligent, data-driven systems that solve real-world problems with clarity and impact.
I’ve worked with startups and on academic projects, developing everything from AI-powered tools to full-stack web applications that are both technically scalable and thoughtfully designed.
I’m drawn to the intersection of software, data, and impact, where smart engineering meets real-world problem-solving. I enjoy crafting products that not only scale efficiently but also feel intuitive and human-centered.

Currently seeking internship opportunities (Fall/Spring) and full-time roles (2026) where I can continue learning, collaborating with great teams, and contributing to systems that scale and make a difference.

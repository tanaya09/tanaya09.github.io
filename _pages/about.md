Software Developer and NYU CS Master’s student passionate about building scalable backend systems and integrating modern ML and LLM capabilities into real-world applications. I’ve worked in fast-paced startup environments, collaborating across teams to deliver robust, production-ready features across full-stack and data-driven systems. Skilled in React, Next.js, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, and Python, with hands-on experience deploying ML-powered services and LLM-based pipelines.

I’m actively seeking Fall 2025 and Spring 2026 SDE internships where I can apply my skills in system design, ML integration, and full-stack development to build impactful products. Let’s connect and create something meaningful.

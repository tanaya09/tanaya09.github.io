I'm Tanaya Pawar, a Master's student in Computer Science at NYU Tandon, passionate about building high-performance systems that solve real-world problems. With a strong foundation in full-stack and backend development, I've contributed to startup products like Referrio and developed impactful academic projects such as CrisisCast and Parameter efficient transformer. 

My work spans modern technologies including React, Next.js, Node.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Python, Docker, cloud platforms like GCP and In the AI domain, I’m passionate about building ML-powered systems, with experience in traditional supervised learning, NLP pipelines, and Generative AI (LLMs, RAG, LoRA). I'm especially drawn to integrating AI into real-world applications that drive user and business value. I enjoy designing scalable architectures, building robust APIs, and integrating intelligent features using modern AI and data tools.

Beyond code, I’m deeply involved in academic research (in NLP, Big Data, and applied AI), and have supported lab and classroom environments through peer workshops, Python/DSA bootcamps, and student-led hackathons. As Co-Chair of my undergrad tech club (CESA), I scaled membership, launched digital outreach campaigns, and led community-driven initiatives.

Currently, I’m seeking impactful SDE and ML engineering internships for Summer 2025 where I can contribute to both system design and intelligent automation.

Hi, I’m Tanaya Pawar a software engineer with a passion for building scalable systems and solving real-world problems with code. My background spans full-stack development, backend APIs, and data-intensive systems, with experience in tools like React, Node.js, FastAPI, and PostgreSQL. I’ve contributed to startups and research projects alike from a real-time support ticketing system to an LLM powered crisis detection pipeline. I’m particularly excited about the intersection of software, AI, and impact-driven tech. Whether I’m working through an API spec, debugging a Kafka pipeline, or collaborating in Agile teams, I enjoy turning complex ideas into reliable, user-centered products. Let’s build something great together.

Currently seeking internship opportunities (Fall/Spring) and full-time roles (2026) where I can continue learning, collaborating with great teams, and contributing to systems that scale and make a difference

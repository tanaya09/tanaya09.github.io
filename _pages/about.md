I'm Tanaya Pawar, a Master's student in Computer Science at NYU Tandon, passionate about building high-performance systems that solve real-world problems. With a strong foundation in full-stack and backend development, I've contributed to startup products like Referrio and developed impactful academic projects such as CrisisCast and Parameter efficient transformer. My work spans modern technologies including React, Next.js, Node.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Python, Docker, cloud platforms like GCP and In the AI domain, I’m passionate about building ML-powered systems, with experience in traditional supervised learning, NLP pipelines, and Generative AI (LLMs, RAG, LoRA). I'm especially drawn to integrating AI into real-world applications that drive user and business value. I enjoy designing scalable architectures, building robust APIs, and integrating intelligent features using modern AI and data tools.

Beyond code, I’ve led technical student clubs, conducted peer workshops, and supported academic research in AI, big data, and NLP. I thrive in fast-paced, cross-functional environments and enjoy transforming ideas into scalable, user-friendly software.

Currently, I'm seeking Fall and Spring 2025 SDE internships where I can contribute to product engineering teams, deepen my backend expertise, and ship meaningful software at scale.

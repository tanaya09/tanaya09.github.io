Hi, I’m Tanaya Pawar, a software engineer who loves turning ideas into systems that actually work.
I’ve built everything from AI-driven tools to full-stack web apps, and I’m especially drawn to projects that blend software, data, and impact.
Whether it’s scaling an API, fine-tuning a model, or simplifying user experiences, I care most about building things that matter.
Currently exploring internships (Fall/Spring) and full-time SDE roles (2026) always excited to learn, collaborate, and create something meaningful.

Let’s connect and build something great together.

Currently seeking internship opportunities (Fall/Spring) and full-time roles (2026) where I can continue learning, collaborating with great teams, and contributing to systems that scale and make a difference

Hi, I’m Tanaya Pawar, a software engineer who loves turning ideas into systems that actually work.
I’ve worked with startups and research teams, building everything from AI-driven tools to full-stack web apps that solve real-world problems.I’m especially drawn to the intersection of software, data, and impact, and I enjoy creating products that are both scalable and human-centered.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; line-height: 1.6;">

Currently seeking internship opportunities (Fall/Spring) and full-time roles (2026) where I can continue learning, collaborating with great teams, and contributing to systems that scale and make a difference.

Let’s connect and create something great together.
